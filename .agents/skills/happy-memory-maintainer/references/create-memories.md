# Create Memories

Create a memory only when the candidate is durable, complete, atomic, and not already represented by active project memory.

## Qualify Candidates

1. Restate each candidate as one context-independent idea.
2. Separate candidates that can change, score, tag, or disappear independently.
3. Exclude momentary work state and incomplete fragments.
4. Identify the nature of the idea so the CLI type reflects meaning rather than topic.

Allow one consolidation point to produce multiple candidates. Keep each candidate on its own creation path.

## Check Existing Knowledge

1. Build a specific textual query from the candidate's canonical project terms.
2. Search related active memories with a limit of `10`.
3. Compare meaning, scope, and current state rather than relying only on exact text equality.
4. Route to update when an active memory represents the same idea but needs correction or refinement.
5. Do nothing when an active memory already represents the candidate adequately.

Do not create wording variants to bypass duplicate or semantic overlap.

## Build and Persist

1. Choose exactly one valid memory type.
2. Write a short discriminative title and self-contained content.
3. Assign importance and confidence independently.
4. Resolve a minimal keyword tag set from bounded vocabulary searches.
5. Construct one complete create document.
6. Run one `create` command per candidate.
7. Accept success only after a zero exit code and `ok: true` response.

Persist candidates sequentially. A failed candidate does not undo earlier creations; continue only with candidates that do not depend on the failed result.

## Finish the Case

Finish with one of these observable outcomes per candidate:

- Created and verified.
- Routed to update.
- Already represented, with no mutation.
- Failed with the CLI error preserved.
